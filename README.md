# Wii U GTX Extractor v2.2
Extracts textures from the GFD ('Gfx2' / .gtx file extension) format used in Wii U games.  
  
Can Also convert .png files into .gtx files!  

A bit of work could get it to extract .bflim files, too.

# Requirements:
Python 3.4 or higher.

PyQt5.

Compressonator.

cx_Freeze. (Optional)
